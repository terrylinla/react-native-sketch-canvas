# react-native-canvas-card-scratch

A React Native component for drawing by touching on both iOS and Android.

## Features

- Support Android
- Stroke thickness and color are changable while drawing.
- Can undo strokes one by one.
- Can serialize path data to JSON. So it can sync other devices or someone else and continue to edit.
- Save drawing to a non-transparent image (png or jpg) or a transparent image (png only)
- Use vector concept. So sketches won't be cropped in different sizes of canvas.
- Support translucent colors and eraser.
- Support drawing on an image (Thanks to diego-caceres-galvan)
- High performance (See [below](#Performance). Thanks to jeanregisser)
- Can draw multiple canvases in the same screen.
