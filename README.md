react-native-sketch-canvas
===================

A React Native component that was build on the react-native-sketch-canvas library from Terry Lin.
It features drawing and also moving the sketch by touching on both iOS and Android.

Features
-------------
* Support iOS and Android
* Stroke thickness and color are changable while drawing.
* Can undo strokes one by one.
* Can serialize path data to JSON. So it can sync other devices or someone else and continue to edit.
* Save drawing to a non-transparent image (png or jpg) or a transparent image (png only)
* Use vector concept. So sketches won't be cropped in different sizes of canvas.
* Support translucent colors and eraser.
* Support drawing on an image (Thanks to diego-caceres-galvan)
* High performance (See [below](#Performance). Thanks to jeanregisser)
* Can draw multiple canvases in the same screen.
* Can draw multiple multiline text on canvas.



#### Properties for Sketch Canvas
-------------
| Prop  | Type | Description |
| :------------ |:---------------:| :---------------| 
| style | `object` | Styles to be applied on canvas component |
| strokeColor | `string` | Set the color of stroke, which can be #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA. If strokeColor is set to #00000000, it will automatically become an eraser. <br/>NOTE: Once an eraser path is sent to Android, Android View will disable hardware acceleration automatically. It might reduce the canvas performance afterward. |
| strokeWidth | `number` | The thickness of stroke |
| onStrokeStart | `function` | An optional function which accpets 2 arguments `x` and `y`. Called when user's finger touches the canvas (starts to draw) |
| onStrokeChanged | `function` | An optional function which accpets 2 arguments `x` and `y`. Called when user's finger moves |
| onStrokeEnd | `function` | An optional function called when user's finger leaves the canvas (end drawing) |
| onSketchSaved | `function` | An optional function which accpets 2 arguments `success` and `path`. If `success` is true, image is saved successfully and the saved image path might be in second argument. In Android, image path will always be returned. In iOS, image is saved to camera roll or file system, path will be set to null or image location respectively. |
| onPathsChange | `function` | An optional function which accpets 1 argument `pathsCount`, which indicates the number of paths. Useful for UI controls. (Thanks to toblerpwn) |
| user | `string` | An identifier to identify who draws the path. Useful when undo between two users |
| touchEnabled | `bool` | If false, disable touching. Default is true.  |
| localSourceImage | `object` | Require an object (see [below](#objects)) which consists of `filename`, `directory`(optional) and `mode`(optional). If set, the image will be loaded and display as a background in canvas. (Thanks to diego-caceres-galvan))([Here](#background-image) for details) |
| permissionDialogTitle | `string` | Android Only: Provide a Dialog Title for the Image Saving PermissionDialog. Defaults to empty string if not set |
| permissionDialogMessage | `string` | Android Only: Provide a Dialog Message for the Image Saving PermissionDialog. Defaults to empty string if not set |
| requiredTouches | `number` | (Optional) Fingers on the screen for drawing to be active. If you set this to 1, drawing is only possible while the user only uses one finger. So for 2 fingers, you can use another action. |
| startToDrawDelay | `number` | (Optional) Delay in milliseconds after which the drawing starts. Use it if you use another PanResponder in the parent. |

#### Methods
-------------
| Method | Description |
| :------------ |:---------------|
| clear() | Clear all the paths |
| undo() | Delete the latest path. Can undo multiple times. |
| addPath(path) | Add a path (see [below](#objects)) to canvas.  |
| deletePath(id) | Delete a path with its `id` |
| save(imageType, transparent, folder, filename, includeImage, cropToImageSize) | Save image to camera roll or filesystem. If `localSourceImage` is set and a background image is loaded successfully, set `includeImage` to true to include background image and set `cropToImageSize` to true to crop output image to background image.<br/>Android: Save image in `imageType` format with transparent background (if `transparent` sets to True) to **/sdcard/Pictures/`folder`/`filename`** (which is Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES).<br/>iOS: Save image in `imageType` format with transparent background (if `transparent` sets to True) to camera roll or file system. If `folder` and `filename` are set, image will save to **temporary directory/`folder`/`filename`** (which is NSTemporaryDirectory())  |
| getPaths() | Get the paths that drawn on the canvas |
| getBase64(imageType, transparent, includeImage, cropToImageSize, callback) | Get the base64 of image and receive data in callback function, which called with 2 arguments. First one is error (null if no error) and second one is base64 result. |

#### Constants

| onStrokeChanged | `function` | See [above](#properties) |
| onStrokeEnd | `function` | See [above](#properties) |
| onPathsChange | `function` | See [above](#properties) |
| onClosePressed | `function` | An optional function called when user taps closeComponent |
| onUndoPressed | `function` | An optional function that accepts a argument `id` (the deleted id of path) and is called when user taps "undo" |

## Background Image
-------------
To use an image as background, `localSourceImage`(see [below](#background-image)) reqires an object, which consists of `filename`, `directory`(optional) and `mode`(optional). <br/>
Note: Because native module cannot read the file in JS bundle, file path cannot be relative to JS side. For example, '../assets/image/image.png' will fail to load image.
### Typical Usage
* Load image from app native bundle
<br/>
  * Android: 
    1. Put your images into android/app/src/main/res/drawable.
    2. Set `filename` to the name of image files with or without file extension. 
    3. Set `directory` to ''
<br/>
  * iOS:
    1. Open Xcode and add images to project by right clicking `Add Files to [YOUR PROJECT NAME]`.
    2. Set `filename` to the name of image files with file extension. 
    3. Set `directory` to MAIN_BUNDLE (e.g. RNSketchCanvas.MAIN_BUNDLE or SketchCanvas.MAIN_BUNDLE)
* Load image from camera
  1. Retrive photo complete path (including file extension) after snapping.
  2. Set `filename` to that path.
  3. Set `directory` to ''
